# WP2: Auditor's Data Preparation Assistant

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-View%20Here-brightgreen)](https://babariri.github.io/wp2_demo/) <!-- Assuming index.html is the live demo link -->

WP2 is a powerful system designed to streamline the tedious and error-prone process of preparing data for audits. It automates the cleaning, aggregation, sorting, and formatting of data from multiple Excel files, transforming it into ready-to-use working papers. This significantly saves auditors valuable time, enhances data accuracy, and ensures consistent, high-quality outputs.

## 🎯 The Problem WP2 Solves

Auditors often spend considerable time manually copying, pasting, and manipulating data from various Excel spreadsheets. This manual process is:
- Time-consuming
- Prone to errors
- Leads to inconsistencies in working paper preparation

WP2 automates these preparatory tasks, allowing auditors to focus on analysis and value-added activities.

## ✨ Key Benefits

- **⏱️ Time Savings**: Drastically reduces manual data preparation effort.
- **✔️ Accuracy Ensured**: Minimizes human error in data handling and calculations.
- **📊 Consistency Delivered**: Standardizes the format and quality of working papers.
- **🚀 Efficiency Boost**: Empowers auditors to work more effectively.

## 🛠️ Features & Tools

The WP2 system provides a suite of tools to:
- Ingest data from multiple Excel files.
- Perform automated data cleaning and validation.
- Aggregate data based on specified criteria.
- Sort and organize data meaningfully.
- Format outputs into standardized working papers.
- (Add any other specific tools or functionalities here)

## 💻 Technology Stack

WP2 leverages a modern technology stack:
- **Core Application**:
    - **Python**: For backend logic and data processing.
    - **Openpyxl**: For robust Excel file manipulation.
    - **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application and user interface.
- **Static Frontend/Demo (if applicable)**:
    - HTML5
    - CSS3 (with modern features like Grid and Flexbox)
    - JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Running the WP2 Streamlit Application

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd wp2_demo # Or the main project directory
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Assuming you have a `requirements.txt` file. If not, we should create one with `streamlit` and `openpyxl`.)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    (Assuming your main Streamlit script is named `app.py` or similar. Please adjust if needed.)
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your web browser.

### Viewing the Static HTML Demo (if `index.html` is a separate component)

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

## 📂 Project Structure (Recommended)

For better organization, we recommend a structure like:
```

│   ├── data_processing.py
│   └── utils.py
├── data/                   # Sample Excel files or data inputs
│   └── input/
│   └── output/
├── static/                 # For index.html, CSS, JS if separate from Streamlit
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
│   └── images/
│   └── index.html
├── tests/                  # Unit and integration tests
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
└── PLAN.md                 # Project planning document (optional)
└── PRD.md                  # Product requirements document (optional)
```
