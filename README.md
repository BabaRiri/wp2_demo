## About the WP2 Tool (Internal Application)

WP2 is a powerful system (not hosted in this repository) that streamlines the tedious and error-prone process of preparing data for audits. It automates the cleaning, aggregation, sorting, and formatting of data from multiple Excel files, transforming it into ready-to-use working papers. This significantly saves auditors valuable time, enhances data accuracy, and ensures consistent, high-quality outputs.
